## üìö Third Party Dependencies

See [DEPENDENCIES](DEPENDENCIES.md) for information regarding XEN's use of 3rd party libraries.

## üèóÔ∏è Creating Projects

XEN provides a [Python script](Scripts/CreateNewProject.py) for generating a new project. Projects must be added
to [Projects.cmake](Projects.cmake)
and the XEN project reconfigured before the project can be compiled.
